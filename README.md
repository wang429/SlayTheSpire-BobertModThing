# SlayTheSpire-BobertModThing

Adds random mod ideas. Currently includes:
 - Updating The Library event to grab a random article from Wikipedia and present the introduction.
 Note: this could end up displaying very little for some articles
 Note: this appears to have a minor, but noticeable effect on the library's load time
 - A yet unfinished fishing event to The Beyond
